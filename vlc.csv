Or this app might stay open, but close that particular mp3 file so you've lost your place. Or this app might totally shut down, so you've again lost your place. If this happens, then when you reopen the file, maybe it will start where you had left off, and maybe it won't. Losing your place isn't a big deal if it's a music file, but if it's an audiobook or podcast, then you'll have to do some seeking. These annoying quirks happen from the lock screen, and when using completely open. Doesn't seem to be a pattern. Randomly works, and randomly fails. Please fix!!! It's so close to being nearly perfect! This is really a really good media player. I started using it on the desktop computer because it was a small file size that played almost any file type you asked it to play. I use it almost exclusively for MP3 files. The thing I love about the app is that you can increase the playing speed in small or large steps (and it adjusts the frequency, of course, so your audiobook doesn't sound like chipmunks.) This is a powerful feature! I wish you could fast-forward the file and not accidentally bump it up to play the next file (like every car stereo, sharing the FF and the NEXT button, so one little slip of your finger and you will lose your place).",3,327,3.1.7,,,most_relevant,org.videolan.vlc

Later, I installed the Fermata app which advised to add VLC for better performance. The Fermata app went bad, so I used the current version of the VLC app and it works great! Much better functionality, it picked up all of my music, and it's much easier to create playlists, and so far hasn't lost them! Great! Update: 11/10/2021 - My phone, a Moto G Power 2021, had a Motorola system update today and all but two of my playlists had the songs removed! I still seem to have all my music but the playlists, except for two of them, have lost all of their songs! They were there as of last Friday, 11/5/2021. At least the app didn't lose my music entirely, only the music in the playlists that I created with my music, but this is still very frustrating as I had made up about 27 playlists. The playlists on my Chromebook, also using a VLC app for Chromebook, are still there and intact. What I really long for is an app that is like the media player on Windows, the earlier version that I've used since Windows XP and have installed on my laptops since from Win 7 through 10. All along the way, the Media Player always picked up all my songs and playlists and I never had to remake the playlists, even when upgrading to the next Windows OS! And Windows Media Player has never lost any of my music or songs in my playlists because of any updates from Windows or any other updates! An app like Windows Media Player, with it's ease of use, especially where creating and retaining playlists are concerned, that would recognize the playlists that have been synced to my phone, pick them up as is so I wouldn't even have to recreate them on the phone app, and never lose them regardless of any updates of any kind, would be great! But so far I've never found one! And to note, the Windows Media Player has been around since at least 2006, so it's abilities are not new technology. I still think that VLC is still a good app as it hasn't lost my music and also plays videos well and has a lot more functionality that it once did, but I know it can be made better, especially for those of us who like to create their own playlists and not have the songs in them disappear from the playlists leaving the playlists empty. It would be great if VLC for Android and Chromebook could be tweaked to have the kind of functionality that Windows Media Player has. I imagine this would make VLC the greatest and best music and media playing app for Android by a truly huge margin! And the app developers would most likely benefit, too! To the developers: If you want to learn more about my experiences in using Windows Media Player in using and creating playlists to get an idea of what I, and possibly others who like creating their own playlists, are looking for, please let me know, as I'm willing to help improve the VLC app if possible. Thanks!",4,297,3.3.4,,,most_relevant,org.videolan.vlc
