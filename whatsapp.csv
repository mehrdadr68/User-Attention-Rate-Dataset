Previously, the time at which a status was uploadd was visible without needing to click on it. It also seems that this functionality has been altered, now the time is only displayed upon clicking. This adjustment has made the status display appear somewhat peculiar to me. I hope u reconsider and change it back because its inconvenient to my user experience.",3,0,2.24.8.85,,,most_relevant,com.whatsapp,

This is probably the best messenger app and has many features other apps don't have. However, here are some bugs preventing it from being 5⭐️ 1. Sometimes when opening the app it says backing up data, it reaches 100 percent but just hangs there, u can't click anything else 2. Sometimes u can't scroll down to see your stickers it will constantly move you back up 3.

A concern Get it more organised such that all the Groups are to have a different icon to the Chats that would be more professional! It's giving some kinda bad experience having the groups and chats on the same icon! Please Work on this on the Next update! Otherwise I will rate your New updated version @ 4/5. To make it More Soothing and easy for one to flex over it Have a different Tap for Groups and Chats! That would be more convenient for the user! Thanks,4,0,2.24.8.85,,,most_relevant,com.whatsapp,
