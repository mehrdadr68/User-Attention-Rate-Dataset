A concern Get it more organised such that all the Groups are to have a different icon to the Chats that would be more professional! It's giving some kinda bad experience having the groups and chats on the same icon! Please Work on this on the Next update! Otherwise I will rate your New updated version @ 4/5. To make it More Soothing and easy for one to flex over it Have a different Tap for Groups and Chats! That would be more convenient for the user! Thanks,4,0,2.24.8.85,,,most_relevant,com.whatsapp,

So, that we as an user can make & save a list (like School, college, office guys ) so that I would not have to struggle for removing saved person or adding new person. So that, whenever I have to add status. By simply choosing my college list , my status would be seen to my college colleagues only.",5,541,2.24.4.76,,,most_relevant,com.whatsapp,

So my opinion is there is add one of the feature in whatsapp. Which is timer message sender, the message we create before some day and we set a date and time for this message. The message will automatically send on this time and date. This feature likes in future. So think about it. Ty",5,78,2.21.13.28,7/22/2021 23:41,,,most_relevant,com.whatsapp
